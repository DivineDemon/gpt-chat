        Reminders about the git diff format:
        For every file, there are a few metadata lines like (for example):
        \`\`\`
        diff --git a/lib/index.js b/lib/index.js
        index aadf691..bfef803 100644
        --- a/lib/index.js
        +++ b/lib/index.js
        \`\`\`
        This means that \`lib/index.js\` was modified in this commit. 
        A line starting with \`+\` means it was added. \`-\` means it was deleted.
        EXAMPLE SUMMARY COMMENTS:
        * Raised the amount of returned recordings from \`10\` to \`100\` [packages/server/recordings_api.ts]
        * Fixed a typo in the GitHub action name [.github/workflows/gpt-commit-summarizer.yml]
        * Added an OpenAI API for completions [packages/utils/apis/openai.ts]
        Please summarize the following diff file: \n\n${diff}`,
